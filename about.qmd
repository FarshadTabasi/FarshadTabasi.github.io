Welcome to my weblog! My name is Farshad, and I am excited to share my experiences and insights with you. With 20 years of experience in the petroleum industry and academia, I have worked on reservoir engineering aspects of oilsands and heavy oil reservoirs. I have also been involved in several reservoir modeling and geomechanics studies of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Currently, I work as a process analytics consultant in the energy industry, providing engineering and data science solutions to optimize production and maintenance costs of refineries and upgraders.

When I am not working, you can often find me indulging in my passions for hiking, playing table tennis and squash, as well as volleyball and tennis. Additionally, I enjoy watching Real Madrid games as a die-hard Los Blancos fan. Despite my loyalty to Real Madrid, I cannot help but admire the unparalleled talent of Leo Messi (The GOAT), which makes life even more beautiful.
