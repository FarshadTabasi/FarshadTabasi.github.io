# Entropy

## Welcome to my weblog!

Welcome to my weblog at https://farshadtabasi.github.io/entropy/! I'm a data scientist with extensive knowledge and experience in petroleum engineering and process analytics. In this blog, I'll share my knowledge and expertise in using Julia, R, and Python for practical applications in these domains. Through my posts, I'll cover various topics, including engineering modeling, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, with a focus on how these languages can be applied to real-world challenges in the oil and gas industry.
