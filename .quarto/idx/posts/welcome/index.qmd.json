Through my posts, I will cover various topics that are relevant to the oil and gas industry, including engineering modeling, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning applications.\n\nAs a process analytics engineer, I rely heavily on `R` for its powerful machine learning capabilities. I have extensive experience with R, having contributed several petroleum engineering packages to the CRAN repository and written several R packages for my own use. My experience with R has given me valuable insights into its potential applications within the oil and gas industry, and I am excited to share this knowledge with others.\n\n`Python` is my language of choice for building infrastructure for automated cloud-based data science projects. I use it for data wrangling, visualization, and deep learning modeling due to its flexibility and versatility. With over 5 years of experience working with Python, I have a deep understanding of how it can be applied to various challenges within the petroleum and process engineering domains.\n\n`Julia` is my go-to language for scientific studies and data science projects. I first started using Julia for reservoir and geomechanics studies four years ago and was impressed by its power and versatility in scientific computing. Julia's exceptional speed and ease of use make it an excellent choice for engineering modeling and simulation tasks. With my experience in utilizing Julia for these purposes, I am excited to share my knowledge of this language and demonstrate its potential applications within the oil and gas industry.\n\nTo summarize, this blog aims to share my expertise and knowledge of Julia, R, and Python in the fields of petroleum and process engineering. My posts will cover a wide range of topics, with a focus on engineering applications utilizing Julia, and also including posts using Python and R primarily focused on data science and machine learning. I hope my readers will find my content informative and valuable, providing them with insights on how to use these languages for practical engineering applications.\n\nThe entire weblog is created by the amazing [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/) package which supports Julia, Python, and R languages. A great contribution from the [`Posit`](https://posit.co/) team. Thanks a lot!\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":["Yeti","../../theme.scss"]},"title-block-banner":false,"title":"Welcome To My Blog","author":"Farshad Tabasinejad","date":"2023-02-25","draft":false,"categories":["announcement"],"image":"julia-logo.svg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
