My posts will cover a wide range of topics, including engineering modeling, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning applications in the oil and gas industry. I hope that my readers will find my content informative and engaging.\n\nIn my daily tasks as a petroleum and process engineer, I rely on R for its powerful machine learning capabilities. I have been using R for over 8 years and have contributed several petroleum engineering packages to the CRAN repository. I have also written several R packages for my own use. I am excited to share my knowledge of R and how it can be used in the oil and gas industry.\n\nPython is my preferred language for creating the infrastructure required for automated cloud-based data science studies. I use it for data wrangling, visualization, and deep learning modeling. I have been using Python for more than 4 years and have found it to be a versatile language that can handle a variety of tasks in the petroleum and process engineering fields.\n\nJulia is my new favorite language for all data science and scientific studies. I started using Julia in reservoir and geomechanics studies three years ago and have found it to be a very powerful language for scientific computing. Julia's speed and ease of use make it an excellent choice for engineering modeling and simulation tasks. I am excited to share my knowledge of Julia and how it can be used in the oil and gas industry.\n\nIn summary, my goal is to share my experience and knowledge of Julia, R, and Python in the domains of petroleum and process engineering. I will be covering a range of topics, including engineering modeling, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning applications. I hope that my posts will be informative and helpful for those interested in utilizing these languages for practical engineering applications."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":["Yeti","../../theme.scss"]},"title-block-banner":false,"title":"A review of dplyr package in R","author":"Farshad Tabasinejad","date":"2023-02-23","draft":true,"categories":["code","R","dplyr"],"image":"dplyr-180x180.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
