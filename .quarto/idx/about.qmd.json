My name is Farshad, and I am excited to share my experiences and insights with you. With 20 years of experience in the petroleum industry and academia, I have worked on reservoir engineering aspects of oilsands and heavy oil reservoirs. I have also been involved in several reservoir modeling and geomechanics studies of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. Currently, I work as a process analytics consultant in the energy industry, providing engineering and data science solutions to optimize production and maintenance costs of refineries and upgraders.\n\nWhen I am not working, you can often find me indulging in my passions for hiking, playing table tennis and squash, as well as volleyball and tennis. Additionally, I enjoy watching Real Madrid games as a die-hard Los Blancos fan. Despite my loyalty to Real Madrid, I cannot help but admire the unparalleled talent of Leo Messi (The GOAT), which makes life even more beautiful.\n\n\n- Computational Thermodynamics\n- Reservoir Characterization\n- Reservoir Simulation\n- Thermal Recovery\n- PTA/RTA\n- EOR of Unconventional Reservoirs\n- Hydraulic Fracturing Modeling and Simulation\n- DFIT and DFIT-Flowback Design and Analysis \n- Process Analytics\n- Artificial Intelligence\n- Machine Learning\n\n## Education\n\n- Certificate in Proffesional Management (PEG) | University of Calgary | 2018\n- Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture | University of Calgary | 2016\n- PhD in Petroleum Engineering | University of Calgary | 2011\n- MEng in Reservoir Engineering | University of Calgary | 2006\n- MSc in Reservoir Engineering | Petroleum University of Technology | 2006\n- BSc in Reservoir Engineering | Petroleum University of Technology | 2003\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":["Yeti","theme.scss"]},"title":"About","image":"images/hiking_photo.jpg","about":{"template":"trestles","links":[{"icon":"mastodon","text":"Mastodon","href":"https://mastodon.social/@farshadtabasinejad@fosstodon.org"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://linkedin.com/in/farshad-tabasinejad-phd-peng-b8442335"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/FarshadTabasi"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
